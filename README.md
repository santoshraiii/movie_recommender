Content-Based Movie Recommendation System
Overview
This repository contains a content-based movie recommendation system. Unlike collaborative filtering methods that rely on user interactions, this system recommends movies to users based on the inherent features and content of the movies themselves.

How It Works
Data Collection: Movie data, including genres, directors, actors, release years, and textual descriptions, is gathered and stored in the system's database.

Feature Extraction: Relevant features are extracted from the movie data, serving as the foundation for comparisons and recommendations.

User Profile: A user profile is created by analyzing the user's historical interactions or explicit preferences, such as previously watched movies.

Content Matching: Using similarity metrics like cosine similarity or TF-IDF, the system computes how closely a movie aligns with the user's profile, resulting in personalized movie recommendations.

Features
Genre-Based Recommendations: Recommends movies based on genre preferences.
Director and Actor Preferences: Takes into account user preferences for specific directors and actors.
Release Year Sensitivity: Allows users to specify preferences for movie release years.
Keyword and Tag Analysis: Considers keywords and tags associated with movies to make recommendations.
